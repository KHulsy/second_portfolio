  <h1 class="display-4">Kaitlin Hulsy: Professional Portfolio!</h1>
  <p class="lead">About: Kaitlin Hulsy is a professor in the English department at Bakersfield College, and at Cal State University, Bakersfield. Additionally, she runs her own editing and political consulting firm, namely Jem Rose Consulting.
      Kaitlin fell in love with coding immediately after deciding to enroll in the UC Berkeley Full-Stack Bootcamp. She will receive certification in Full Stack Web Development from the University of California, Berkeley at the end of August. She looks forward to taking her skills back to her students. In March of 2020, Kaitlin put together a website and repository so that students may learn, write, and have hope using only her phone. Since March, five Bakersfield College students have had their work published </p>
      The website was featured in the June edition of Bakersfield Life Magazine, in addition to The Bakersfield Californian, and The Renegade Rip. Three of her flash-fiction pieces have been accepted for publication
      in Flash Fiction Magazine, Storyland Literary Review, and Bakersfield College's own literary journal, The Grapevine. Prior to teaching, Kaitlin completed a Bachelor's of Arts in English, with a specialization in Literature in the Culture of Information
      from the University of California, Santa Barbara. She also has an M.F.A. in Creative Writing and Writing for the Performing Arts from the University of California, Riverside.She
      also holds a single-subject English credential from the University of LaVerne. Completion of her MFA required successful submission of a 120-page original manuscript. In March, Kaitlin also formed Operation Dulce. The organization has been instrumental in delivering
      care packages to medical professionals on the front lines. Kaitlin was an opener for the first all-female comedy showcase in Bakersfield, California. Her one-acts and sketches have been performed 
      on-stage at the only donation-based theater in the country, The Empty Space Theater. Kaitlin is grateful to have learned multiple beautiful coding languages in a very small period of time.
      <p> She hopes to one day use her new-found powers for good.<p>
